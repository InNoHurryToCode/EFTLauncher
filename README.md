Escape From Tarkov server emulator written in C# 2.0

## About
while polivilas made an fantastic [server emulator](https://github.com/polivilas/EmuTarkov), it lacks features that I want to have, and the source code is one giant mess.

My intention is to write a server emulator which is written in C#, easier to maintain, easy to understand, and properly documented. Features I might add are changable ports, character body customization, database ported from JSON to MySQL, multiple accounts on one server.

Note that I might abandom this project at any moment.
