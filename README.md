Escape From Tarkov server emulator written in C# 2.0

## About
While polivilas made an fantastic [server emulator](https://github.com/polivilas/EmuTarkov), it lacks features that I want to have, and the source code is one giant mess. My intention is to write a game launcher which is written in C# and easier to maintain than EmuTarkov. Features I might add are character body customization, database ported from JSON to MySQL, multiple accounts on one server.

Note that I might abandom this project at any moment.
